Hi,

I am writing to formally request that this matter be escalated and handled by a higher-level manager rather than my assigned property manager.

According to Lumo's website, under the section "What happens when we receive a disturbance report?" (https://lumo.fi/en/for-resident/the-neighbour-is-causing-a-disturbance-what-can-i-do), Lumo clearly states that when a disturbance report is received, the property manager will contact the resident causing the disturbance, explain that the behaviour is not acceptable and take further action if the disturbance continues. This includes issuing a formal warning and, if necessary, terminating the tenancy agreement.

In my case, this procedure has not been followed as described.

My first nuisance report was submitted at the beginning of January 2026. I was informed that the issue had been "started to be investigated", but no information was provided regarding what concrete actions were taken. No follow-up or clarification was given for several weeks.

After submitting a second nuisance report at the end of the same month, I was advised to "encourage friendly and appropriate direct discussion with your neighbour first" which explicitly tells me to solve issue myself. This response is inappropriate given the seriousness and persistence of the disturbance and it contradicts Lumo's own stated procedure, which places responsibility on the property manager once a formal disturbance report has been made.

The disturbance consists of extremely loud door and cabinet slamming that causes the walls to shake from the main door through to kitchen cabinets and the dish rack. These incidents occur during quiet hours, including nighttime. This level of noise is not minor or occasional. It directly affects sleep, health and the ability to function normally at work the following day.

Under Laki asuinhuoneiston vuokrauksesta (AHVL 481/1995), the landlord has the right to terminate a tenancy agreement if a tenant "viettää tai sallii vietettävän huoneistossa häiritsevää elämää" (61 §, 1 momentti, 4 kohta). The Act further provides that, in such cases, the landlord may not proceed without first issuing a written warning (62 §), unless specific statutory exceptions apply. These provisions form the legal basis for Lumo's own disturbance handling procedure.

Despite multiple documented disturbance reports, I have not received any clear confirmation that the tenant causing the disturbance has been contacted, warned, or otherwise addressed in accordance with these statutory requirements.

Instead, my subsequent feedback has resulted only in general explanations of disturbance rules, without reference to concrete actions taken in my case. This creates the impression that my concerns are being downplayed rather than handled through the legally required process.

In addition, the property manager consistently closes the communication thread after each response, preventing me from replying or continuing the discussion. This practice restricts effective communication, limits my ability to clarify or respond and forces me to submit new reports repeatedly for the same ongoing issue.

Given the above, I respectfully request that this matter be escalated for review. I ask for clear written confirmation of:
- What concrete actions have been taken in response to my disturbance reports
- Whether the tenant causing the disturbance has been contacted or issued a written warning
- How Lumo intends to proceed in compliance with AHVL 61 § and 62 § and Lumo's published disturbance procedure

Lumo states that disturbance issues are taken seriously. I expect this commitment to be reflected in the handling of my case through clear, documented and lawful action.


Kind regards,
